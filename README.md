Project Scope
Design Problem & Objective: Agriculture remains one of the most hazardous industries, with a significant number of accidents resulting from machinery, environmental hazards, and human error. The objective of this project is to design and develop an AI-based farm safety system that can detect and assess hazards in real time, providing farmers, insurance agents, and safety consultants with actionable risk assessments. This system will utilize image and video data from smartphones to recognize safety hazards and generate reports with targeted recommendations. The solution aims to reduce farm-related injuries, improve insurance risk assessments, and promote safer farming practices.
